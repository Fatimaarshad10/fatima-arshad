                                My journey began with a passion for art and digital drawing, which soon evolved into a fascination with technology. At 13, I was creating digital sketches; today, I build scalable web applications.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Transitioning from art to programming was challenging, especially in male-dominated spaces. Through perseverance, I taught myself full-stack development and delivered real-world MERN projects.

                                This journey inspired me to become an educator. I have trained over 600 students, empowering beginners to find their path in tech. Teaching has strengthened my confidence, communication, and sense of purpose.

                                Now, I work as a full-stack developer, collaborate globally, and contribute to international hackathons.
